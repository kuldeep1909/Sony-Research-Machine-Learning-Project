# Sony-Research-Machine-Learning-Project

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of the **Sony Research Project**, where various data analysis and machine learning techniques are applied to understand and predict key metrics relevant to Sony's business operations.

## Project Overview

The project leverages data science methodologies to analyze Sony's data and gain insights into various aspects of their business. The key goals include:
1. **Data Analysis**: Exploring the data to identify patterns and trends.
2. **Machine Learning Models**: Building and evaluating models to predict outcomes and support business decision-making.
3. **Visualization**: Presenting findings through clear and informative visualizations.

## Folder Structure

- **Data**: Contains the datasets used in the project.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, analysis, and modeling.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts that encapsulate the core functionalities of the project.
- **Results**: Output files, including visualizations and model performance reports.

## Notebooks

The primary notebooks in this repository include:
1. `Data_Exploration.ipynb`: A notebook focused on data cleaning, transformation, and initial exploratory analysis.
2. `Model_Training.ipynb`: Includes various machine learning models implemented to predict target variables.
3. `Visualization.ipynb`: Contains code for generating visualizations and dashboards.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines.
- **Evaluation**: Detailed analysis of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Visualization**: Interactive visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `jupyter`

Ensure that these libraries are installed in your Python environment before running the notebooks.
